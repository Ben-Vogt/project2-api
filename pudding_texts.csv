Trouble in Paradise
 
			SEQUENCE A 

FADE IN  NIGHT
  
MED. SHOT   DOOR OF A HOUSE   
A cheap residential district. The house has no architectural 
character; it is not certain where we are. Near the entrance 
door is a garbage can, full.

A dog is nibbling at some of the garbage. We hear whistling, 
footsteps. A garbage man comes into the picture. He shoos 
the dog away. Without pause in whistling, he lifts the 
garbage can and, followed by camera, goes to the end of the 
block, which is only a few steps. Now we discover we are in 
Venice. In the background is a major canal and a typical 
bridge--romantic background. Gondolas are passing. In the 
foreground at the sidewalk is the garbage gondola, piled 
high with garbage. The man dumps his load, leaves the empty 
can on the sidewalk, gets in the gondola, and paddles away 
with the grace of a gondolier. Now, in a beautiful tenor

singing a passionate I"

	The RKO trademark FADES OUT, to reveal a road lined with palm
	trees, spectrally long and straight like a vista in a Dali
	painting.  Along this road and from a far distance two tiny
	figures advance toward the camera.  Over this scene the TITLE
	and CREDITS are SUPERIMPOSED.  The two figures continue to
	advance, growing more discernible all the time.

	As the credits FADE, the two human figures advancing along
	the road are more clearly discernible.  Although they are not
	close enough to distinguish their faces, it can be seen that
	one of them is an enormously tall, cadaverous negro, clothed
	only by ragged, tight-fitting trousers and that the other is
	nurse, dressed in crisp white uniform and cap, with a dark
	cloak over her shoulders.

Shooting toward a small building (Hoboken Yacht Club) set upon a wharf 
floating about twenty-five yards off shore. A long, narrow gangplank 
leads from the wharf to the shore, and on either side of the wharf are 
large ocean liners which are being unloaded by arc light. In the B.G. 
is the glittering New York skyline. A great liner, blazing with light, 
is headed down river. A ferry chugs across to Manhattan. There is a 
counterpoint of ships' whistles, some shrill, others hauntingly muted.

It is the office of the longshoremen's local for this section of 
waterfront. Coming along the gangplank toward the shore is an isolated

	EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - CLOSE SHOT

	We see a close view of a roof parapet and the curved rail of 
	a fire escape. In the bag, are large skyscrapers with all 
	their windows fully lit in the late winter afternoon. This 
	background is used for the CREDIT TITLES of the picture.  
	After the last card has FADED OUT, we HOLD on to the empty 
	parapet, when suddenly a man's hand reaches and grips the 
	top of the rail. It is followed by another hand and, after a 
	beat, we see the face of a man in his early 30's. He is an 
	Italian type, with rough features. He turns quickly and looks 
	below him and then turning back, springs up over the empty 
	parapet and is lost from view. We STAY on the EMPTY SCENE 
	for a second or two as we HEAR the scraping of boots on the 
	iron ladder. Someone else is coming up. Presently, two more

A crew of African-Americans are laying tracks in rural Alabama. The crane 
operator is the only white man on the section gang.

INT. BUNK CAR
The dormitory of the section gang. The men are through for the day and 
lounging on their bunkbeds. DUFF ANDERSON plays checkers with FRANKIE, using 
bottle tops as pieces. Duff makes the winning move and Frankie, disgusted, 
turns over the board. He saunters over to JOCKO, who is shaving in a broken 
mirror. Frankie watches him with a grin.

			JOCKO  
	Go to hell, Frankie.

			FRANKIE  
	Man, you sure one ugly cat!

He takes the cigarettes Jocko has rolled, sailor-style, into the sleeve of 
his T-shirt.

			JOCKO  
	Why don't you guys buy your own?

			FRANKIE  
	'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.

He stops in front of an older man, who is writing a letter.

	After a moment the feet move off and we TRACK with them,

	The feet pause there for a moment. A piece of heavy
	window cord drops INTO FRAME. We FOLLOW as it is dragged
	along to the low table. Then the feet move over to a large
	ornate desk. The cord is pulled up OUT OF FRAME. Pause.
	The feet walk over to a chair by the wall. It is picked

CLOSE SHOT of TOM GRUNEMANN, attractive young
executive, sitting at the head of the dining room
table carving a turkey for Thanksgiving Day dinner.
There are joyous sounds of celebration. The CAMERA
PANS around the table revealing the happy family
and guests. Among them are KLUTE and CABLE.

Camera stops at Mrs. Grunemann who sits at the foot
of the table opposite her husband. She smiles
across at him with pleasure. We cut to Tom
Grunemann smiling back at her. We cut back to a
closeup of Mrs. Grunemann  looking back at her
husband with love. We cut back to Tom Grunemann's
chair - only now it is empty. The joyous sounds
disappear on this cut. It appears that Tom
Grunemann has disappeared before our eyes. One
moment he is there, and the next moment he is gone.
The camera pans back down the table, only now it is
empty except for Grunemann's children and Mrs.

INT. BASEMENT - WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
In the pitch darkness of an old shivery east coast cellar, the audience sits amongst SILENCE. Then... Rising from the THEATRE'S REAR SPEAKERS...faint tiny claws, many, moving as one, scuttle; seemingly in the roof of the THEATRE. CHEWING. SCRATCHING. TEARING.

There are rats in the basement!
The scuttling stops. Silence. Beat; another, then...a metal doorknob, distinctive to a classic antiquated house, CLACKS and echoes. O.S., A door slowly squeaks open.
From an upstairs room, a rhomboidal patch of light creeps across the TOP RIGHT OF FRAME. Within the light holds the hesitant shadow of an average sized man at the summit of a flight of stairs, descending into a cold, dark cellar.

O.S., a light switch FLIPS. A FLASH! An exaggerated POP! The light bulb blows in the f.g., a fuse-box CRACKLES, sprays ti"

While this remains, we hear: ""I believe in America.""
Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a

THE EXORCIST



EXTERIOR- IRAQ- EXCATVATION SITE- NINEVEH- DAY 

Pickaxes and shovels weld into the air as hundreds of excavators 
tear at the desert. The camera pans around the area where 
hundreds of Iraqi workmen dig for ancient finds. The caption 
Northern Iraq appears at the bottom of the screen as the digging 
continues. The camera then follows a young boy running bare foot 
over the rocky mounds. He comes to a stop and the camera is 
positioned in between the boys legs looking at and aging man also 
digging. 

YOUNG BOY
(In Iraqi language)
They've found something... small pieces. 

MERRIN
(In Iraqi language)
Where? 

YOUNG BOY
(In Iraqi language)
At the base of the mound. 

The boy runs off and the old man pulls himself to his feet to 
follow. The old man walks to the base of the mound where another 
man who looks in command is there to greet him. 

MAN
(In Iraqi language)
Some interesting finds. Lamps, arrow-heads, coins."

	A BOLT OF LIGHTNING!

	A CRACK OF THUNDER!

	On a distant, rainy hill, the old Frankenstein castle, as
	we knew and loved it, is illuminated by ANOTHER BOLT OF
	LIGHTNING.

	MUSIC:  AN EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN LULLABY begins to PLAY in
	the b.g.

2	ANOTHER ANGLE								2

	as we MOVE SLOWLY CLOSER to the castle.  It is completely
	dark, except for one room -- a study in the corner of the
	castle -- which is only lit by candles.

	Now we are just outside a rain-splattered window of the
	study.  We LOOK IN and SEE:

3	INT. STUDY - NIGHT								3

	An open coffin rests on a table we can not see it's contents.
	As the CAMERA SLOWLY CIRCLES the coffin for a BETTER VIEW...

		NARRATOR
	This story is about Howard Beale
	who was the network news anchorman on
	UBS-TV --

A BANK OF FOUR COLOR TELEVISION ON MONITORS

It is 7:14 P.M., Monday, September 22, 1975, and we are
watching the network news programs on CBS, NBC, ABC and
UBS-TV, the network of our story.  The AUDIO is OFF;
and head shots of WALTER CRONKITE, JOHN CHANCELLOR,
HOWARD K. SMITH and HARRY REASONER, and of course,
the anchorman of our network, HOWARD BEALE, silently
flit and flicker across the four television screens,
interspersed with the news of the day "

		A dim shape, massive, threatening, swims towards us from the

		the cool New England waters:  ""Farmer John"" wetsuits with
		cut-off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including

               -- Two well-bundled youths shovel out a suburban driveway 
               while their father scrapes ice off the family car.

               -- Youths pelter a passing car with snowballs. Others, more 
               daring companions, grab onto the car's rear bumper and hitch 
               a free ride across the icy roads and past a sign which reads 
               ""Grand Rapids City Limits.""

               -- Christmas decorations hang from the lamp posts on Monroe 
               Avenue.

	FADE IN:

1	INT. OFFICE, ADVERTISING AGENCY, MIDTOWN - EVENING

	WIDE SHOT--A large and very comfortable office over-
	looking St. Patrick's Cathedral.  At the moment the
	office is filled to bursting with men and women, slumped
	in chairs, sitting on desks, all of them very tense.
	Among the crowd of people we note:  MURRAY FISHER, a
	young and very ambitious junior executive and PHYLLIS
	BERNARD, an attractive woman in her early thirties.
	She is a lawyer with the agency.

	At the moment, TED KRAMER, nice-looking without being
	what you would call a matinee idol, paces back and
	forth.  His tie is loosened, he checks his watch every
	fifteen seconds.  Clearly he is very distraught.

EXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH

impact.

snow plain and disappears into the distance.

EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY

A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled

              in 3-D and seems to jump right out at them.
 
              The opening credits follow.  Ominous theme music fills the
              soundtrack, growing darker and more dissonant.
 
              The theme music slowly dissolves into the sound of a radio
              news broadcast, as the credits continue to unfold.

Blood Simple



                                      ""BLOOD SIMPLE""

                                            By

                                 Joel Coen and Ethan Coen

               LANDSCAPES

               An opening voice-over plays against dissolving Texas 
               landscapes--broad, bare, and lifeless.

                                     VOICE-OVER
                         The world is full of complainers. 
                         But the fact is, nothing comes with 
                         a guarantee. I don't care if you're 
                         the Pope of Rome, President of the 
                         United States, or even Man of the 
                         Year--something can always go wrong. 
                         And go ahead, complain, tell your 
                         problems to your neighbor, ask for 
                         help--watch him fly. Now"

Prologue
Legend has it, in the mystic land of Prydain. There was once a king so cruel, and so evil, that even the gods feared him. Since no prison could hold him, he was thrown alive into a crucible of moltin iron. There his demonic spirit was captured, in the form of a great black cauldron. For uncounted centuries The Black Cauldron lay hidden, while evil men searched for it. Knowing whoever possessed it, would have the power to resurrect an army of deathless warriors. And with them, rule the world.

CLOSE ON a finely-worked Medieval tapestry.  In the
background, beyond the intricate foliage, stands a moated
castle where a troop of mounted hunters set out for the
chase with dogs and lances.  In the foreground, a lovely
young maiden heads for the forest, carrying an armful of
flowers.  The forest, stylistically rendered by the
weaver's art, has numbers of small animals cunningly
worked into the warp and woof.  A Green Man, clad only in
leaves and vines, hides behind a tree, watching a stately
pair of unicorns grazing on the greensward.

               holstered gun hung on the corner of the bed. The still shape 
               of a man, a bedroll his only protection from the splintery 
               planks. This is EMMETT, fast asleep.

               The door of the shack bursts inward as a Gunman crashes in.

		     TITLE SEQUENCE:  UNDER WATER - NIGHT

		     As titles and music play, we move
		     slowly beneath the water off the
		     coast of Amity.

		     We swim beneath a dock, threading
		     our way through pilings...

		     We move through the water, swimming,
		     just swimming, with all the time in
		     the world.

		     We move over some junk -- the 
		     rusting front end of an automobile...
		     We're going somewhere...

		     The water becomes shallow and we
		     stop.  Up through the surface, the
		     images distorted, we see the lights
		     of a town...Amity...

		     We move on, swimming again, just
		     swimming, moving through the water
		     until, suddenly, the water swirls
		     with motion around us.  We experience
		     the sensation of turning and then

THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS

We open on a black screen. 

SUPERIMPOSE: OCTOBER 30, 1988

FADE IN ON:

EXT. ABANDONED FARM - AFTERNOON

A large, run down farm.

CLOSE ON: 

A cardboard skeleton nailed to the wall of a shed.

CLOSE ON: 

A bed sheet in the form of a ghost. It's gently swaying 
back and forth in the wind. 

CLOSE ON: 

A half finished barn. A tumbleweed blows by the screen.

CLOSE ON: 

A scarecrow with a pumpkin for a head. It sits on a 
tractor, an axe by his side. 

CLOSE ON: 

A fence. A sharp piece of farm equipment is hanging from 
it.

CLOSE ON: 

A Halloween style weathervane.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT - RAINING

An ambulance appears in the distance, it's headlights 
barely penetrating the wall of darkness. It's a large and 
lonely road, surrounded on either side by a thick wall of 
towering trees.

POV 

We are looking in on the two PEOPLE in front. They're both 
men in their thirties or forties. They don't talk to each 
other, just stare straight ahead. We"

       As the MAIN TITLES begin, two sounds are heard.  The first is 
       the low, moaning WIND.  The second is a slow SCREECHING.  
       It's the kind of noise that makes you grit your teeth.

       FADE IN:

       EXT. ELM STREET - DAY

       GRAY SURFACE FILLS THE SCREEN.  At first it's hard to 
       recognize this rough, indistinct surface.  But when a CHILD'S 
       HAND drags a piece of colored chalk ACROSS THE FRAME, we 
       realize that we're seeing a very close view of a CONCRETE 
       WALKWAY.

       EXT. ELM STREET - DAY

       A SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS FOLLOW THE MOVEMENTS of the tiny hand 
       as it proceeds to lay out an intricate CHALK DRAWING on the 
       walkway.

       For a while, we are too close to identify the image that is 
       being created.  But as THE CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see a 
       youthful artist's representation of a two story HOUSE.

                        WHO SHOT ROGER RABBIT?

     This movie starts the way all movies should... with a
     cartoon.  It's not a Disney or a Warner's.  It's not a
     Fleischer, an MGM, or a Lanz.  This is a lesser known
     studio.

ERIK THE VIKING - Terry Jones ---------------
Blackness. Flames begin to lick upwards from the bottom of the screen. Suddenly all hell breaks loose. Screaming, yelling. Black figures flash across the foreground, with the flames still burning behind. There follows a confusion of burning,  raping, killing and looting - we don't clearly see what's going on. Suddenly we cut to the interior of a hut. The door is in the process of being broken down.  The  camera  pans  onto  the  close-up  face  of an attractive girl who is staring  in  horrified  fascination at the door. Her arms are white with fresh dough and flour. Suddenly the door bursts open and  a wild-looking Viking leaps into the hut. He holds a sword. He looks around wildly and then his eyes come to rest on the girl. This Viking, I'm afraid, is Erik. We are  about to see him in the worst possible light so be prepared. The girl,  whose  name  is  Helga,  cowers,  and  looks  terrified  but resolute. Erik glan"

The Magic Toyshop
 
1. 	Exterior. A London square. Night.

   	But a shabby square. Wet and misty, creating a halo 
	around a street lamp - an old-fashioned, gas one, the 
	period is circa 1954/5. The mist partially obscures 
	the surroundings. Out of the mist emerges a man, 
	gaunt, raw-boned, in a soiled trenchcoat open over a 
	shabby, ill-fitting suit. His five o'clock shadow is 
	just showing. His thoughts are worlds away from his 
	surroundings. His age is indeterminate, anything from 
	mid-twenties to mid-forties.
   
	He is heading towards the row of shops on one side of 
	the square: fog hides the square itself but the 
	outlines of one or two trees are visible - the 
	diffused light from the street lamp illuminates some 
	leaves.
   
	The shops comprise a greengrocer's - as FRANCIE 
	approaches, a woman in a blue overall reaches out and 
	pulls down a blind, hiding the piled fruit; and a

COREY
I don't feel anything.

DC
Come on, it's graduation.

COREY
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he 
ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, ""You're a real 
live-wire, Love Mr Carroll.""  Y'know, it's all so phoney.

EXT. SEATTLE - DAY

DC
He wants to leave things on a good note.

COREY
Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new 
word.

INT. COREY'S ROOM - DAY

LLOYD DOBLER, COREY FLOOD AND DC are talking together.

DC
Lloyd, she's being difficult.

LLOYD
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.

COREY
That's unlikely.

LLOYD
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?

COREY
But you never had a first date.

LLOYD
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We 
ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.

COREY
That's not even a scam.

LLOYD
What's a scam?

COREY
Going out as friends.

No it's not.  A scam is lusting.

The Complete Script

Compiled by Ben Scripps <34rqnpq@cmuvm.csv.cmich.edu>

NARRATOR:     Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a young prince lived in a
              shining castle.  Although he had everything his heart desired,
              the prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind.  But then, one
              winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and
              offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter
              cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at
              the gift and turned the old woman away, but she warned him not
              to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within.  
              And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness
              melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress.  The prince
              tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that
              there was no love in his heart, and as punishment, she

LOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop.  She is in her
early-thirties, but too old to be doing this.  She is very
pretty and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her
shift.  She is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter
into a bus tray underneath the counter.  It is making a
lot of RACKET, which she is oblivious to.  There is
COUNTRY MUZAK in the b.g., which she hums along with.


INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING

THELMA is a housewife.  It's morning and she is slamming
coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen
sink, which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some
stuff left from last night's dinner which had to ""soak"".

Flying.  Not at the intangible height of a jet, but at
spitting distance from the treetops.  We're in central
Alaska, the Big Lonely, just north of the Arctic Circle.

A thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills
like a deep-pile carpet.  Up at treeline the forest thins to
tundra, a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the
coming of autumn.

On the horizon, the hills rise to meet the Endicott
Mountains, a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and
jagged that snow cannot stick to its face.  This is how all
North America once looked -- raw, indomitable.

Then, abruptly coming into the SCENE is a colossal etching
across the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin.
Bisecting this country like a metallic ribbon -- or a scar,
depending on your point of view -- is the 800-mile-long
Trans-Alaskan Pipeline.

	A legend tries to place us - -

	ISLA NUBLAR
	120 MILES WEST OF COSTA RICA

	It's quiet for a second.  A ROAR rises up from the jungle,

               EXT. - NIGHT

               It's raining like hell. Flashes of lightning reveal momentary 
               glimpses of a decayed urban/industrial landscape. Far below 
               us, a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in the 
               drowning earth. We descend toward the rock. Sporadic flashes

1	TITLES - The sound of a woman walking on a deserted street

2	EXT NIGHT STREET - FADE UP - We see a woman's feet wearing red stiletto
	shoes. It is late at night and she is very alone.

	She turns a bend and enters a darkened street, her heels making a
	distinctive click on the path.

	Suddenly we see a figure in the darkness - the womans pauses for a beat
	before continuing. She approaches the figure who is dressed in a heavy
	motorbike jacket... The figure turns round - it is a girl with bleached
	blonde hair, wearing a low cut, tight white T Shirt. The white seems to
	glow a little.

	Without warning, the WOMAN produces a hammer from her bag and raises it
	above BLONDE...

	Screams....

3	EXT NIGHT PARK - The young BLONDE lies motionless on the floor, most of
	her clothes ripped from her still body. The sound of digging can be

	Her body is dragged out of shot...

EXT. STREET - DAY
A UPS Man with a big pot belly is walking down the street, whistling and carelessly tossing a 
package in the air. We hear the sound of broken glass in the box. He passes a professional woman.
UPS MAN
 Good morning, UPS!
He tosses the box behind his back like a basketball, then acknowledges another passerby.
UPS MAN
 UPS, good to see you!
He takes a couple of steps, then flings the package incredibly high into the air, spins completely 
around and expertly drops to one knee and catches the box. A Hispanic man passes.
UPS MAN
 Buenos dias. Uo Pay eSsay.
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
The UPS Man dodges a couple of black kids as though playing basketball. He runs up the front 
steps of the building. He reaches out to open the front door and inadvertently flings the package

     Version 1 Script

     from an original idea by Luc Besson

     Notes:
     The beginning is identical to the movie, so we considered 
     useless reporting it here.  It's from Mathilda's first rifle 
     training scene that the original script is totally different 
     from the movie. This version is much more violent and the 
     affective relation between Leon and Mathilda shows no more 
     ambiguities. In this version, Mathilda was to be aged 13 or 
     14

     ** * * * * * * * * *

     Leon and Mathilda arrive on the roof of a building which 
     faces Central Park. They get close to a wall and maintain this 
     position. Sunlight floods the park.

                             By Janet Kovalcik



       SETTING:  MADISON, PENNYSYLVANIA 1974


       CLOSE-UP OF VADA SULTENFUSS' FACE

                                   VADA
              I remember before I was born, wounded up like 
              a fur ball in the highly overrated fetal 
              position, luckily I'm not claustrophobic, but 
              on rainy days I still feel a tightness in my 
              left shoulder. So now that my stepmother's 
              pregnant, I understand what the baby's going 
              through, and I'm not jealous at all, really, 
              not at all.

1	INT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 

	A dark, empty room. 

	The door bursts open. A MAN and WOMAN enter, drunk and 
	giggling, horny as hell. No sooner is the door shut than 
	they're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at 
	flesh, mouths locked together. 

	He gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over 
	instead. Hell with it. He's got more urgent things to do, like 
	getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. She 
	arches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. He slams her against 
	the wall, ripping her skirt. We hear fabric tear. 

	He enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the

Color 1ST ANNIVERSARY BANNERS flap along with swirling dust and bending vegetation
as a HELICOPTER touches down on the CHEMCO grounds, within its tall fences, near
its administration building. 

The banner reads 

			CHEMCO MALAYSIA--1ST ANNIVERSARY
			  This is just the beginning.

CHEMCO EXECUTIVES are eagerly standing by with a handful of uniformed SECURITY
PEOPLE, keeping a respectful distance.

A MALE SPOKESPERSON, well groomed and David Duke-plastic-surgery handsome, talks
into a wireless mike, ADDRESSING THE CAMERA as his THREE-MAN CREW tapes.  He walks
toward the front entrance--

               IMAGES hit the screen: ROSA PARKS, Peace Demonstrators 
               stuffing FLOWERS in the barrels of National Guard rifles. 
               Protesters in Birmingham, rallies on the White House Lawn.

               Mixed in with the MUSIC comes NEWS BITES -- quick catchwords 
               of 60's turmoil -- ""More troops to Vietnam,"" ""Bus Boycott,"" 
               ""Sit ins,"" ""Draft Dodgers,"" ""Malcolm X speaking.""

Transcribed Script
The following is a rough script of the 10th Anniversary version of the movie, as pieced together by me using 
(1) the DVD subtitles, (2) the CD lyrics booklet, (3) the official novelisation and (4) my ears. Massive thanks 
to Jackie (aka Ainaweth) for looking this script over and correcting what needed to be corrected. All other 
mistakes are my own, additional corrections are most welcome.

[Opening transitions: Exterior, London docks, day.]

ENGLISH CHORUS
In sixteen hundred seven
We sail the open sea
For glory, God and gold
And the Virginia Company
For the New World is like heaven
And well all be rich and free
Or so we have been told 
By the Virginia Company
So we have been told
By the Virginia Company
For glory, God and gold
And the Virginia Company

               We see a clean moving POV illuminated by headlights. We're 
               floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate, 
               desert landscape. This gliding, eerie POV continues as credits

               soon we're moving through BLACKNESS.

EXT.  HIGHWAY.  AFTERNOON.

A ribbon of freeway stretching into a blue and pink late
afternoon sky. A huge dark sedan, windows tinted gold,
headlights blazing, powers directly for us.

CUT TO: A heavy, low-slung, pickup truck traveling toward
the sedan.

WIDE SHOT: Sky, freeway, the cars closing.

TIGHT ON: The sedan.

TIGHT ON: The pickup.

Like thunderous, jousting opponents, the cars pass in a
deafening cacophony of noise.

INT.  TRUCK.  AFTERNOON.

TIGHT ON: The fat face of GREGORY, yelling at the
disappearing sedan.

Alien Resurrection 



EXT.  DEEP SPACE SILENT BLACK.

We sweep slowly across an endless tapestry of stars. Finally she comes 
into view:

the U.S.S. AURIGA. A massive research vessel that sits majestically 
just beyond Pluto's orbit.

We TRACK ALONG the side of the ship, and 

INT.  AURIGA

along the silent, empty corridors, coming at last to a door with two 
guards standing rigid in front of it. Full armour, powerful 
shockrifles, expressions empty and cold.

INT.  MEDLAB

Along a row of screens, where we see the first signs of life readouts, 
lights, data -- all shifting and collating on the blinking screens. 

As we move ALONG them, a figure-in a labcoat passes through the frame, 
then another,leading us along the lab to settle on what looks like a 
Cryogenic tube, not big enough for a human.

Still TRACKING around it, we glimpse inside some vague, fetal mass 
encased in a clear, aspic-like gel.

               Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon (Brain Damage)"" plays as

               the first chorus, SUNLIGHT flares over the lunar horizon and 
               a crescent sliver of THE MOON is illuminated - huge, filling 
               the screen from top to bottom. We're in space, circling around 
               from the dark side until a HUGE FULL MOON fills the screen 
               with whiteness - TITLES continue as we pull back from the

formerly known as TENTACLE
by Steven Sommers & Robert Mark Kamen
extended revisions by Robert Mark Kamen

Revised Draft
Jan. 1st, 1996

- - -

	OPEN TO:

	A FLASH OF LIGHTNING rips the HOLLYWOOD PICTURES LOGO away, and we
	find ourselves in the middle of...

1	EXT. STORMY SEA - NIGHT

	SUPERIMPOSED: SOUTH CHINA SEA

	The dark blue waters roil and boil and foam. THUNDER CRACKS. LIGHTING
	FLASHES.

									CUT TO:

2	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

	An enourmous Japanese BATHYSCAPHE free-falls through the water. An
	autonomous fifteen-man submersible. Almost futuristic in its design.
	The nose cone is an amazing ultra-high-pressure plexi-dome. LETTERING
	along the side tells us this is the ""SHINKAI 90000.""

	COMPUTER PRINTED across the SCREEN are the WORDS:

		ASSIGNMENT:		GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION.
					SUB-OCEANIC SEISMIC RESEARCH.
					TECTONIC PLATE SURVEILLANCE.

		ADDENDUM:		ABOUT TO BREAK THE WORLD'S RECORD
					FOR THE DEEPEST DIVE...

3	INT. SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT

	decanters with red and white wine.

	reading.  MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually
	surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than

     Stygean darkness.

     Wet CLICKING SOUNDS. A BEAM of purplish ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT
     reveals a mosaic of moving forms... COCKROACHES. They skitter
     restlessly under the beam's intensity. SERIES OF SHOTS -- the
     UV Beam passing over various parts of the space. Pipe webs,
     walls, girders -- all covered with the insects. Thousands of
     them.

FADE IN ON:

EXT. DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN

Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN

We're looking down at what used to be called ""The End of the Known
World."" A landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding.

In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine.

Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging
over a cliff:

AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid.

Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up
the ice. A human figure. This is:

JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007.

Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has
an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black
backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to

CRACK! A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off, CRASHING onto the rocks
below. Regaining his foothold, Bond"

	The room is bare, dusty. A ceiling fan turns. The 
	wall clock ticks. Craig, 30 years old and small, sits at
	a collapsible card table. The only item on the table is a
	book. Craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. It's entitled
	""Sit."" Craig opens the book. It reads: ""sit sit sit sit
	sit..."" over and over, page after page. Craig closes the
	book. He begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs.
	He looks at the book again. It is now entitled ""Die.""  He
	opens it up.  ""die die die die die...""  A rooster crows.


									CUT TO:


	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

	Craig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest,
	crowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for 
	work, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest.


				 LOTTE
		    Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin

Disney's Tarzan Movie Script






Typed by a disney fan with the username of Disneyphile on the Disneysites.com Message Board

Song: Put your faith in what you most believe in 
Two worlds, one family 
Trust your heart, let fate decide 
To guide these lives we see 

A paradise untouched by man 
Within this world, blessed with love 
A simple life, they live in peace 

Softly tread the sand below your feet now 
Two worlds one family 
Trust your heart, let fate decide 
To guide these lives we see 

Beneath the shelter of the trees 
Only love can enter here 
A simple life, they live in peace 

Raise your head up, lift high the load 
Take strength from those that need you 
Build high the walls, build strong the beams 
A new life is waiting, but danger's no stranger here 

No words describe a mother"

Boiler Room (2000)by Ben YoungerMore info about this movie on IMDb.comFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY 






EXT. GARDEN STATE PARKWAY - NIGHT

Three luxury buses with blacked-out windows speed toward
Atlantic City.  A laser show explodes off of Trump Plaza.

INT. BUS - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

SETH DAVIS stares out the window.

Seth is 20 years old.  No menacing physical presence but a
sharpness that you feel right off.  He's a smart kid.
Confident but edgy.  Eyes always darting.

The bus is filled with 19 and 20 year olds.  They wear very
sharp suits: Hugo Boss, Armani, very slick.

They're going nuts.  Cards games in the aisle.  Five guys
throwing dice in the back.  Booze and coke, yelli"

The Blair Witch Project


In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near
Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary called ""The Blair Witch
Project"".

A year later their footage was found.


Man off camera: You look a little blurry.  Let me zoom out okay?

Heather:  Okay.  Huh.

Man:  Okay got you.

Heather:  This is my home.  Which I am leaving the comforts of, for the 
weekend.  To explore the Blair Witch.

(Close up of pile of books)

Heather:  Some essential reading.  How To Stay Alive in the Woods, cause you 
never know what's going to happen.

(Picks up book)

Heather: And this is a very important book, because it has the article about 
what happened at Coffin Rock.

Man:  That's pretty old.

Heather:  Yeah it's totally old.

Heather:  And this is my field notebook.

	BLACK

	In black, we hear a chain-gang chant, many voices together, 
	spaced around the unison strike of picks against rock. A 
	title burns in:

	O muse! 
	Sing in me, and through me tell the story 
	Of that man skilled in all the ways of contending... 
	A wanderer, harried for years on end...

	On the sound of an impact we cut to:

	A PICK

	splitting a rock.

	As the chant continues, wider angles show the chain-gang at 
	work. They are black men in bleached and faded stripes, 
	chained together, working under a brutal midday sun.

	It is flat delta countryside; the straight-ruled road 
	stretches to infinity. Mounted guards with shotguns lazily 
	patrol the line.

	The chain-gang chant is regular and, it seems, timeless.

	We slowly fade out, returning to

	BLACK

	The last of the voices fades.

                         HAPPY CAMPERS

                         A SCREENPLAY (?)
                         BY
                         DANIEL WATERS (!)











                                                  THIRD DRAFT

                                                  OCTOBER 1998














          NOTE FROM THE PERSON WHO'S PUTTING THIS ONLINE:

          HERE IS AN EARLY DRAFT OF THE SCREENPLAY.
          IT FEATURES A HIKE INSTEAD OF A HURRICANE AND
          A SINGLE GOD-LIKE NARRATOR INSTEAD OF A SERIES
          OF SUBJECTIVE, IN-CHARACTER NARRATORS.  THERE'S
          A LOT MORE PETER STORMARE (OBERON) IN THIS.

          FOR THE ONLINE TEXT VERSION OF THIS EARLY DRAFT,
          ALL ""DELETED SCENES"" AND ""DELETED DIALOGUE"" WILL
          BE MARKED WITH RIGHT-MARGIN BRACKETS: ---->                      ]

JASON X - Final Shooting



	JASON X
	By Todd Famer

	WE OPEN ON:

	An EYE

	We have seen this eye before, but we can't be sure just
	where.  It stares at us implacably.  Malevolently.  It
	blinks.  Blinks again.  Then closes.  We are in...

	DARKNESS

	The darkness is slowly broken by moving vertical lines.  At
	first we don't realize what we're seeing.  But soon the lines
	resolve themselves into PILLARS.

	We are moving past pillars.  A vast line of them -- cold,
	concrete -- marching away into the distance.

	INTERCUT

	Extreme close-ups reveal bits and pieces of maybe... a
	figure.  We see the hint of a shoe, a link of a chain, a
	scrap of tattered leather... A MASK.  An EYE.  The eye closes
	and again we are in --

	BLACKNESS

	Now we hear FOOTSTEPS.  We go from black to gray as we move
	past the large concrete pillars.  In the distance looms --

	A PEDESTAL

	Rising high off the seeping concrete floor, it is framed by
	pillars on either si"

FADE IN

1.	OUTSIDE COUNTRY HOUSE - EXT. / NIGHT

An ancient house, standing lonely in the middle of a 
deserted landscape in Northern Germany; lying there like a 
sleeping giant under the starry sky.

But something seems strange: All of the windows and doors 
have been nailed shut.

Text chart: ""1976""

The headlights of a car pierce the darkness.  A car halts 
in the yard.  Three MEN step out.  One of them is wearing a 
police uniform.  The men switch on their flashlights and 
look around. 

				MAN #1

               INT. SPORTSMAN'S LODGE - SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - DAY

               A large crowd has gathered to watch two WHITE BOXERS square 
               off in a temporary ring in the center of a converted banquet 
               hall. One is BOBBY, the other is RICKY. They are drawn 
               together to start the bout by a bell and a hand gesture as 
               the REFEREE backs away. Immediately the two fighters unload 
               a relentless barrage of POWER PUNCHES. Neither man is holding 
               back, and the punches all find purchase in the swelling faces 
               of their opponent. The crowd rises to its feet in appreciation 
               of this rare level of competition in the lower strata of the 
               heavyweight division.

            A violent electrical storm.  Veins of light pulse outward, branching
            off into a spidery network of 

            GLOWING INTERCONNECTEDNESS

            We are inside a human brain.  A pack of neurons FIRE OFF to the left,
            and rocket their way across synapses to the optic nerve.  Passing the
            eye socket, they speed toward a silky, curvilinear membrane (the
            retina) on which we see an image projected:

            AN UPSIDE DOWN COMPUTER SCREEN

            Neurons PING into the membrane: the picture suddenly FLIPS RIGHT SIDE
            UP and we follow the light, flashing in a blur through the iris and
            cornea until, exiting the eye we reverse POV and

	A group of dark-skinned girls wearing cheerleading outfits 
	align themselves in formation on the sidewalk. They begin to 
	dance. No music can be heard. The sound of the girls' bodies 
	is our soundtrack. We hear their strained breathing, palms 
	and sneaker bottoms pounding while they hum and count softly 
	to themselves in an effort to keep the rhythm.
	
	SLO-MO: We explore the bodies of the dancers; their bright 
	eyes and sweaty brows, their stomping feet and colliding 
	hands (dark side and light side). The younger girls perform 
	provocative dance movements, the older girls repeat them.

               EXT. WOODS

               The Rangers plunge into thick woods. Branches slap at them,
               but the sound of gunfire keeps them going. Captain Malcolm
               is still in the lead, flanked by two young men who are
               obviously brothers. The big, handsome one is COLE YOUNGER;
               the skinny one with the lopsided hair is BOB YOUNGER.

               They break through the other side of the woods, emerging
               behind a rickety set of fence-post fortifications. Instantly
               GUNFIRE tears apart the trees around them. The Captain's
               horse goes down, and the Younger brothers dive and roll to
               hide beneath the palisade.

               The Captain, still alive, has fallen beyond the wooden

INT. CAR DRIVING DOWN COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

KIRSTY GOODING looks out the passenger window as the trees go
whizzing past. She's attractive, late twenties, warmly
sophisticated. Something makes her smile. She turns to the
driver and thinks real hard as she says this.

                    KIRSTY
          Okay. Cubic root of nine thousand two
          hundred and sixty one.

TREVOR is her husband, late twenties as well. God gave him
brains and beauty. He has used them both prodigiously.

          Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now

1940.  Below us lies an infinite ocean.  CREDITS PLAY over this
unrelenting waterscape until we spy...

A sequin of light.

The PROP ROAR is deafening.  A Navy LOOK-OUT mimes to his PILOT,
""Go down, go down.""

Circling, we descend on the water.  Soon ""whitecaps"" resolve into
scattered wreckage.  One scrap winks at us again.  It's a small
boat.

An empty tin is being rocked back and forth, its bottom catching
sunlight.  We're so CLOSE that we can't see who does the

               OVER A BLACK SCREEN:

               We hear the tinkling of an old-fashioned MUSIC BOX. It's 
               playing the familiar childhood melody of ""OLD MACDONALD HAD

               There's something a little eerie and dissonant about it.

               In the background, we hear the sound of FARM ANIMALS... a 
               COW mooing, a HORSE neighing, and so on.

               A LITTLE BOY, six years old, is sitting next to some bales

Identity Read the complete shooting draft in pdf format
April 1, 2002 green revised draft.  Screenplay by Michael Cooney (revisions by James Mangold)

IMDB Info
Official Site

Synopsis: Strangers from all different walks of life: a limo driver escorting a movie star, parents with a young son, a cop transporting a convict, a prostitute, a young couple, and a motel manager are caught up in a nasty rainstorm, stuck at a motel in desolate Nevada. Soon they realize they may be at the motel for another reason when one by one, people start getting killed off. As tensions flare and fingers are pointed, they have to get to the bottom of why they're there. Meanwhile in an undisclosed location, a psychiatrist is trying to prove the innocence of a man accused of murder in an eleventh hour trial. How these two through-lines are related can only be found in Identity.

We push in on the book and it magically flips open to the first page: a drawing of small Papa Elf in his wonderful work shop.

The real life Elf and Workshop of the drawing we have just seen.  PAPA ELF, 540 years old or roughly 55 in human years, is surrounded by scores of strange and specific tools and some scattered half-built toys.

So you're here for the story?  Okay.  Just let me wet my whistle.
He pours himself a shot of milk in a snow-flake shot glass and downs it.

                                      Screenplay by

                                 Joel Coen and Ethan Coen

                                 Based on the 1955 movie

                                    ""The Ladykillers""

                                     by William Rose

                

               EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY

               A BOAT

               Specifically, a garbage scow.

               We see it from ON HIGH, chugging down the placid but mighty 
               Mississippi.

               Head credits play over COVERAGE of the garbage scow. No sound, 
               except for an incongruously heroic score.

               The COVERAGE is a little rough, coarse-grained; along with 
               the overbearing score it almost suggests an industrial film 
               rather than a feature.

               One piece of sound -- the toot of the boat's horn -- is 
               obviously library. And not a new library either.

                     Italo Calvino once said that myth is the
                     hidden part of every story, the buried
                     part, the region that is still unexplored

                     light on what happened.  My name is

               A pure white screen. Idyllic stillness. All of it looking and
               feeling like the heavens are supposed to.

               After some seconds of calm, water seems to mist the screen
               and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest
               this is a man's P.O.V. Then, suddenly, the white screen is
               tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead
               man.

Kat sits bolt upright, wide eyed. She looks around in

My Pure Joy READ the script
Undated, Unspecified draft script by James Cullen Bressack

IMDB Info

Synopsis: On the outside Adam appears to be a normal teenager, but underneath...his mind has been so rotted by trauma from his past and the gory films he watches, that he has blurred the lines between reality and pretend! This prompts Adam to start killing people in similar ways to films he watches, making sure to put his own little spin on it.
